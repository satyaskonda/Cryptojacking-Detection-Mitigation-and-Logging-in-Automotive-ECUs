Overview
This project is focused on detecting cryptojacking in a simulated automotive ECU environment. The simulation is built using Kali Linux running in a virtual machine, configured to replicate the resource-constrained environment of an actual Renesas R-Car 3 SoC-based ECU.

The system tests the effectiveness of a cryptojacking detection system by running in a simulated environment with 4GB of RAM, 2 CPU cores, and a minimal Linux setup. This allows the detection system to operate under the constraints typically found in real automotive ECUs.

Key Features:
Cryptojacking detection: Monitors system resources for signs of unauthorized cryptocurrency mining activities.

Alert System: Sends email notifications and logs blockchain transaction hashes upon detection.

Simulated Automotive Environment: Replicates key aspects of automotive ECUs (CPU architecture, memory, and peripherals).

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you’ll need to clone the repository and follow the installation steps below.

Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:

Virtualization software: Such as VMware or VirtualBox.

Kali Linux (or a similar Linux distribution).

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automotive-ecu-cryptojacking.git
cd automotive-ecu-cryptojacking
Set up the virtual machine:

Import the Kali Linux image into your preferred virtualization software.

Configure the VM as follows:

CPU: 2 cores (2 GHz each).

RAM: 4GB.

Storage: 20GB disk image.

Network: Limit bandwidth to 100Mbps, simulate latency up to 100ms.

Install dependencies within Kali Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Configure the system for cryptojacking detection:

Set up monitoring scripts in Kali Linux for detecting unauthorized mining activities.

Configure the alert system (email and logs).

Usage
Once the setup is complete, run the cryptojacking detection system using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 detect_cryptojacking.py
This will start the detection system, and it will monitor the system for cryptojacking activities. If detected, an alert email will be sent, and the blockchain transaction hash will be logged.

Configuration
You can adjust the configuration settings by modifying the config.yaml file. Here are the main configurable options:

CPU & Memory Constraints: Adjust the allocated resources to better mimic different types of automotive ECUs.

Alert Settings: Configure email notifications and logging settings.

Example config.yaml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
cpu_cores: 2
memory: 4GB
network_bandwidth: 100MBps
email_alerts: true
log_transactions: true
